### 🧠 About Me
🎬 *“What are they typing in movies?”* — that one question pulled me into tech.  
💡 I don’t rush to master things — I stay until I truly understand them.  
💻 Self-taught and currently learning to decode the magic behind screens (and the bugs that come with it).  
🎓 Balancing college, curiosity, and the occasional bug-induced panic.  
🌘 Mysterious, messy, mildly sleep-deprived — but loving every bit of it.
